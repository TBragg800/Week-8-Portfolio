* [Github Repository](https://github.com/TBragg800/Week-8-Portfolio)
* [Github Deployed Site](https://tbragg800.github.io/Week-8-Portfolio/)

### Summary:
The purpose of this assignment is to create a responsive 3 page portfolio. The site has a consistent Navbar with working Nav links on each page. I also added an interactive element to the name expand and collapse "Bragg". I tried to use all of the semantic html I thought made sense and also tested the code with an Html validator. Through that process I encountered and corrected an issue with the aira-describedby attribute. The layout ustilizes the bootstrap grid system on each page and incorporates a mixture of rows, coloumns and further nested rows & columns inside of those elements. I purposfully attempted to create a style that did not immediately mimic the examples in an effort to explore and learn about the concepts. I also wanted to constructively take the comments from our last assignment and utilize more classes to expand on the CSS. I finished each page with a streamlined sticky footer including social media links and a copyright statement.


### Pseudo Code:
* Add different background and refine color scheme.
